<P style="text-align:center;">In the video diaries (from the X-Factor, back in 2010) the boys joke about their roles in the band and they said Louis was the leader, Harry was the flirt, Zayn was vain, Niall was the funny one, and Liam was the smart one. In interviews they have agreed that they all play equal roles in the band, though.</P>
